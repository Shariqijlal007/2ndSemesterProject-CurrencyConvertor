# 2ndSemesterProject-CurrencyConvertor
In this Currency Converter Java Program, users will be given options to select conversion type, i.e., from one currency to another. This feature will allow users to enter number which will be converted (for example, Saudi Riyaal) and give the converted number (for example, Pak Rupees).
